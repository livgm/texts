# Facial recognition and racial bias

The topic of Artificial Intelligence and Facial Recognition is slowly but surely being integrated in all parts of our daily lives - whether it be using Snapchat filters, logging in on an iPhone or the police using facial recognition techniques to identify criminals. All of this seems incredibly handy, but it does not work for everyone. Facial recognition techniques are significantly less likely to correctly identify a Black woman than to identify a white woman. This blog post seeks to explain what the problem is, the reasons behind it and suggest ways to improve this.

## The problem

On May 24th, 2019 Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez questioned Joy Boulamwini, a MIT graduate and founder of the "Algorithmic Justice League", an organization that is challenging racial and gender-based bias in Machine Learning, in a congressional hearing on the effectiveness of facial recognition algorithms.

> <b> Ocasio-Cortez: </b> Ms. Buolamwini, I heard your opening statement and we saw that these algorithms are effective to different degrees. So, are they most effective on woman? </br>
<b> Buolamwini: </b> No </br>
<b> Ocasio-Cortez: </b> Are they most effective on people of color? </br>
<b> Buolamwini: </b> Absolutely not. </br>
<b> Ocasio-Cortez: </b> Are they most effective on people of different gender expressions? </br>
<b> Buolamwini: </b> No, in fact, they exclude them. </br>
<b> Ocasio-Cortez: </b> So what demographic are they mostly effective on? </br>
<b> Buolamwini: </b> White men. </br>
<b> Ocasio-Cortez: </b> And who are the primary engineers and designers of these algorithms? </br>
<b> Buolamwini: </b> Definitely white men. </br>


Based on Joy Buolamwini's research for her master's thesis titled <b> Gender Shades </b>, IBM's facial recognition software misgenders Black women almost 35% of the time as compared to 0.3% for white men.

If facial recognition is being used in as many situation as it is right now, we have a duty to make sure that it works on everyone and not just on the people who look like most

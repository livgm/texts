# Responsibility as a programmer

## Should programmers be ethically and legally responsible for the code they write ?

In [StackOverflow’s annual developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#ethics) the question “Do developers have an obligation to consider the ethical implication of their code?” was asked. 80 per cent of developers thought that they do but almost 15 per cent said that they were unsure. Another question asked who was ultimately responsible for the unethical code. Only 20 per cent said it was the developer's fault. Clearly, this is a topic important to a lot of people in the field of Computer Science.

The problem concerns more than the area of developers- it is also a fundamental societal question. Is blindly following an assignment wrong? Who is responsible for a product? This questions goes far beyond the scope of this post and therefore this will only focus on the CS aspects.

### Ethical

On one hand, the existence of open source code makes it difficult for developers to make sure their code is not abused in any way. If someone were to write a program and make it available on GitHub, anyone could use this code to potentially harm people. This was by no means the developer's intention and they would probably never know. The programmer should, to the best of their abilities, make sure that their code cannot be abused. </br>
A prominent example is the situation concerning whistle-blowers. It is easy to think that anyone who writes code can simply deny this request and come forward. But what if someone was tasked by the government to write code that was against the law? If the person were to do this they would probably face lower charges for writing the program than they would for treason. It can be understandable that, since for a lot of people their livelihood depends on their job, risking their job or possibly even life is not worth disclosing the moral wrongdoings to the public. </br>
Additionally, anyone who has the power to create things as influential and potentially dangerous as programs should feel responsible for what they do. Their impact on society is so grave that they have a special kind of social contract to not do any harm to people around them, including users of their code. </br>
While I strongly believe that anyone who creates things that have as much of an impact on society as computers do has a moral obligation to write moral code and has to take responsibility for this, even including misuse of the code, legal aspects further complicate this issue.

### Legal
When the Volkswagen emission scandal was made public in 2015, many wondered who the person responsible for everything was. Later most people realised that a myriad of people were responsible, ranging from executives to developers.
</br>Perhaps one of the most prominent convictions was the one of James Liang, an engineer at Volkswagen. When he had to appear in front of court, his lawyer said that Liang was "not a mastermind of the emission scandal" but rather "blindly following instructions. " [Liang was convicted to serve three years in prison.](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-volkswagen-emissions-sentencing/vw-engineer-sentenced-to-40-month-prison-term-in-diesel-case-idUKKCN1B522K) </br>
<code>“Ignorantia juris non excusat”</code> is an idea in legal studies that says that not being aware of the law does not protect one from being charged for the crime, which also applied in this scenario.
</br>
Similarly, Marcus Hutchins, known for stopping the WannaCry attack, [was convicted to 5 years in prison](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/world/europe/marcus-hutchins-wannacry.html) in April because he wrote a banking malware called "Kronos" in 2014. </br> In both examples legal issues are fairly clear-cut.     
It gets much more difficult once open source code gets involved. If someone forks a GitHub project and uses it to harm people, there are multiple people at fault - the programmer(-s) as well as the person executing the attack.
</br> In addition to that, not every program is sufficiently safe. If there was a server not sufficiently protected against cross-site-scripting, the programmer is at fault for not having implemented security measures but obviously the hacker committed the illegal activity. Both contribute to the harm in their respective ways. </br>

### Conclusion
This is an incredibly complex and strongly debated topic that simply cannot be discussed in a single blog post. Nevertheless, it is important to note that everyone should be aware of the impact programs can have and therefore feel responsible for the code they write but for some legal issues, responsibility becomes incredibly complex. </br>
